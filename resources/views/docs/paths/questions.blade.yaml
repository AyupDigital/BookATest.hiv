      This will create a completely new set of eligibility questions.

      Even if you only intend to add a new question, the entire set will be recreated. This means all clinics will
      need to respecify their eligibility criteria.

      This endpoint will only return a list of all the current eligibility questions.

      It's important to realise that previous questions cannot be accessed through the API, even though they remain in
      the database.
